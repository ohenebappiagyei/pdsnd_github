### HOW IT WORKS
In the `bikeshare.py`, the command `ipython bikeshare.py` is entered and then, based on what the user wants, there are four questions that will change the answers:
1. Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?
2. Would you like to filter the data by month, day, none or both?
3. If they choose month, which month?
4. If they choose day, which day?
5. If they choose both, then day and month is entered.

### Description
Bikeshare.py is a program that helps you access the csv files of 3 cities and interactively get the information you need. This is set up as a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal that answers questions about the dataset. The experience is interactive because depending on a user's input, the answers to the questions on the previous page will change!

### Files used
1. Washington.csv
2. Chicago.csv
3. New_York_City.csv
